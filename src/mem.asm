; ============================== The Algorithm =================================
; This memory allocation algorithm is a basic one. Memory is allocated in 
; blocks. A block consist of a header which is laid out like this:
;
; |<------------------------- 64bit Word Header -------------------------->|                                     
; [LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL LLLLLLL|F]
;  ^      ^        ^        ^        ^        ^        ^        ^         ^
;  0      7        15       23       31       39       47       55        63
;
; bit | name
; 63  | F   : Free flag
; 0-62| L   : Length field
;
; So a header consists of a free flag and a length field. If the free flag is 
; set then the allocator is allowed to claim and/or split the block for a new
; allocation. The length field is the amount of space allocated for the block
; which is located after the header.
; 
; The algorithm stores the address of the block with the lowest address that's
; marked as free ( LFB: lowest free block ). If there is none, that value will
; be the end of the address space.
;
; When allocating the algorithm will check if there is an LFB, if not it's 
; create a new block at the end of the address space by calling the `brk` 
; syscall. If the is an LFB available, the length of it is checked. If the size
; of the block is greater or equal to the requested allocation size, it's marked
; for allocation. If LFB doesn't fit the requested allocation size, the 
; allocator will iterate through all the blocks after the LFB until it either
; finds a block with fits the requested allocation size or reached the end of 
; the address space. If it reached the end of the address space, a new block is
; created at the end of the address space.
;
; If a previously allocated block - marked as free - is selected for a new 
; allocation, it's size is compared with the requested allocation size. If there
; is enough space left ( the length of two headers, 16 bytes ) then a new free
; block is created behind the newly allocated one with the remaining size. If 
; the free block has less than those 16 bytes left, those bytes are likely never
; to be used for a new allocation and therefore just becomes a part of the new
; allocation ( which means we've actually claimed more memory requested for the 
; allocation ). The length of the new block is written down in the header and 
; the free flag is unset.
; 
; Freeing memory simply consists of setting the free flag of the specified 
; allocation and updating the LFB if the address of the free'ed block is lower
; than the current LFB. 

; Just a 64bit length field

; A block is not worth being split if the remaining size is less than
; a header + 8 bytes
